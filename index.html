                    During my SDE internship at AWS CloudFront with the Fleet Health team, I designed and implemented an automated availability calculation system in Python. This system retrieved metric configurations from an AWS DynamoDB table and queried Amazon's monitoring services based on these configurations to calculate availability for various CloudFront services. Additionally, I developed infrastructure-as-code scripts using AWS TypeScript CDK for DynamoDB setup and data seeding, along with Ruby scripts for synthesizing Apollo environments, DJS jobs, and deployment pipelines. This system not only saved the team 4 hours of manual work per sprint but also provided a dashboard that displayed availability, which was presented weekly in organization-level leadership meetings. I contributed significantly to automating availability calculations for CloudFront services, streamlining processes, and ensuring data-driven decision-making through a comprehensive dashboard, while also enhancing infrastructure management through infrastructure-as-code scripts.

        During my tenure at GMetri, I undertook several technically challenging projects. I designed and implemented the GMetri file manager, architecting the database, API layers, and UI, providing users with an efficient way to manage virtual assets within the platform. I also engineered seamless integration with third-party ECommerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce, skillfully connecting their APIs with GMetri's backend and creating an ECommerce user interface for the VR engine. Furthermore, I developed robust import/export functionality for GMetri's VR experiences, empowering users to collaborate effectively across workspaces. My technical prowess extended to optimizing APIs, where I migrated database queries to Zapatos, resulting in an impressive 80% reduction in API response times. Additionally, I automated testing processes, implementing Selenium for platform testing and conducting load testing of GMetri APIs with JMeter, ultimately saving the company around 2 hours of manual testing work every week. My contributions significantly enhanced the functionality, efficiency, and performance of GMetri's AR/VR/XR products.

                        <h3>Vector Quantization Image Compression</h3>
                        <p>
                            An implementation of the Vector Quantization Image compression algorithm in C++. Vector quantization (VQ) is a classical quantization technique from signal processing that allows the modeling of probability density functions by the distribution of prototype vectors.

                        <h3>Flappy Helix 3D</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed a puzzle based 3D ball game in Unity and C# with a team. Given the tower/s with different levels of puzzle difficulties, the player controls the ball to reach the top of the stage with the least amount of time. There are various kinds of obstacles. On some occasions, the player can gain power-ups (such as boosters) to pass through obstacles.

                            A rubik's cube solver that uses the blindfolded algorithm in C. The program can either take input state of a cube or start with a randomly shuffled cube state. The program uses the blindfolded algorithm to solve the cube and displays the steps to solve the cube.
